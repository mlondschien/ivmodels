    "## Risk and Time Preferences: Linking Experimental and Household Survey Data from Vietnam\n",
    "\n",
    "Tomomi Tanaka, Colin F. Camerer, and Quang Nguyen (2010) investigate causes for risk preferences in Vietnam. Individuals from 25 households were interviewed for each of 289 villages.\n",
    "The authors work with a subsample of in total 181 households from 9 villages.\n",
    "From the interviews, they estimate measures of risk preferences, including the curvature of the utility function. We investigate how this is affected by income and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used by Tanaka et al. (2010) can be downloaded from https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/112336, but this requires an institutional login. We assume this has been downloaded into the working directory."
